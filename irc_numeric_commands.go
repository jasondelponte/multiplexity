//  Source: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812#section-5
//  Refactored for go vars

//  Numerics in the range from 001 to 099 are used for client-server
//  connections only and should never travel between servers.  Replies
//  generated in the response to commands are found in the range from 200
//  to 399.

var RPL_CREATED = "003"

//  "This server was created <date>"

var RPL_MYINFO = "004"

//  "<servername> <version> <available user modes>
//  <available channel modes>"

//  - The server sends Replies 001 to 004 to a user upon
//  successful registration.

var RPL_BOUNCE = "005"
var RPL_ISUPPORT = "005"

//  "Try server <server name>, port <port number>"

//  - Sent by the server to a user to suggest an alternatsive
//  server.  This is often used when the connection is
//  refused because the server is already full.

var RPL_USERHOST = "302"

//  ":*1<reply> *( " " <reply> )"

//  - Reply format used by USERHOST to list replies to
//  the query list.  The reply string is composed as
//  follows:

//  reply = nickname [ "*" ] "=" ( "+" / "-" ) hostname

//  The '*' indicates whether the client has registered
//  as an Operator. The '-' or '+' characters represent
//  whether the client has set an AWAY message or not
//  respectively.

//  - Replies 311 - 313, 317 - 319 are all replies
//  generated in response to a WHOIS message.  Given that
//  there are enough parameters present, the answering
//  server MUST either formulate a reply out of the above
//  numerics (if the query nick is found) or return an
//  error reply.  The '*' in RPL_WHOISUSER is there as
//  the literal character and not as a wild card.  For
//  each reply set, only RPL_WHOISCHANNELS may appear
//  more than once (for long lists of channel names).
//  The '@' and '+' characters next to the channel name
//  indicate whether a client is a channel operator or
//  has been granted permission to speak on a moderated
//  channel.  The RPL_ENDOFWHOIS reply is used to mark
//  the end of processing a WHOIS message.

//  list.  At the end of all reply batches, there MUST
//  be RPL_ENDOFWHOWAS (even if there was only one reply
